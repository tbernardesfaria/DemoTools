# # #' Estimate net migration using residual methods: stock change,
# # #' time even flow and cohort even flow
# # #'
# # #' @details
# # #'
# # #' 1. The stock method (\code{mig_resid_stock}) is the difference in stocks that
# # #' survive between t and t+5, and the first age group is based on the difference
# # #' with the surviving births by sex.  It provides net migrants by lexis cohort
# # #' parallelograms, and basically such info gets used as end-period migration
# # #' since the migrants don't get exposed to mortality within the period.
# # #'
# # #' 2. The time even flow (\code{mig_resid_time}) method uses the result from
# # #' the first option, but splits it back into lexis period squares and assumes
# # #' that half of the net migrants get exposed to the mortality risk during this
# # #' period. Such info can get used as evenly distributed migration by period,
# # #' but the assumptions lead to zig-zag age patterns that are highly implausible.
# # #'
# # #' 3. The cohort even flow (\code{mig_resid_cohort}) method provides the most
# # #' meaningful pattern of net migration by age consistent by cohort and assumes
# # #' an evenly distribution within the 5-year period, and half of the migrants
# # #' get exposed both fertility and mortality within this period.
# # #'
# # #' @param pop_m_mat A \code{numeric} matrix with population counts. Rows should
# # #' be ages and columns should be years. Only five year age groups are supported.
# # #' See examples.
# # #'
# # #' @param pop_f_mat A \code{numeric} matrix with population counts. Rows should
# # #' be ages and columns should be years. Only five year age groups are supported.
# # #' See examples.
# # #'
# # #' @param sr_m_mat A \code{numeric} matrix with survival rates for males. Rows
# # #' should be ages and columns should be years. ** This matrix should have
# # #' one column less than \code{pop_m_mat} and \code{pop_f_mat}. For example,
# # #' if the last year in these matrices is 2050, then the last year in
# # #' \code{sr_m_mat} should be 2045. **
# # #'
# # #' @param sr_f_mat A \code{numeric} matrix with survival rates for females. Rows
# # #' should be ages and columns should be years. ** This matrix should have
# # #' one column less than \code{pop_m_mat} and \code{pop_f_mat}. For example,
# # #' if the last year in these matrices is 2050, then the last year in
# # #' \code{sr_f_mat} should be 2045. **.
# # #'
# # #' @param asfr_mat A \code{numeric} matrix with age specific fertility rates.
# # #' Rows should be ages and columns should be years. ** This matrix should have
# # #' one column less than \code{pop_m_mat} and \code{pop_f_mat}. For example,
# # #' if the last year in these matrices is 2050, then the last year in
# # #' \code{asfr_mat} should be 2045**. This row will usually have fewer age groups
# # #' (rows) than in the population matrices or survival matrices, so the user
# # #' needs to supply the specific ages in the \code{ages_asfr} argument.
# # #'
# # #' @param srb_vec A \code{numeric} vector of sex ratios at birth for every year.
# # #' The years should be the same as the years in \code{sr_m_mat},
# # #' \code{sr_f_mat}, and \code{asfr_mat}.
# # #'
# # #' @param ages A \code{numeric} vector of ages used in the rows in
# # #' \code{pop_m_mat}, \code{pop_f_mat}, \code{sr_m_mat}, \code{sr_f_mat}.
# # #'
# # #' @param ages_asfr A \code{numeric} vector of ages used in the rows in
# # #' \code{asfr_mat}.
# # #'
# # #' @return A list with two matrices. One is for males (called `mig_m`) and the
# # #' other for females (called `mig_f`). Both matrices contain net migration
# # #' estimates by age/period using one of the three methods.
