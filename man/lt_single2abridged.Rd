\title{calculate an abridged life table that is consistent with a life table by single year of age}
\usage{
lt_single2abridged(lx, nLx, ex, Age = 1:length(lx) - 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{lx}{numeric. Vector of lifetable survivorship at single ages.}

\item{nLx}{numeric. Vector of lifetable exposure at single ages.}

\item{ex}{numeric. Vector of Age-specific remaining life expectancy at single ages.}

\item{Age}{integer. Lower bounds of single ages.}

\item{...}{optional args, not currently used.}
}
\value{
Abridged lifetable in data.frame with columns
\itemize{
\item{Age}{integer. Lower bound of abridged age class},
\item{AgeInt}{integer. Age class widths.}
\item{nMx}{numeric. Age-specific central death rates.}
\item{nAx}{numeric. Average time spent in interval by those deceased in interval. }
\item{nqx}{numeric. Age-specific conditional death probabilities.}
\item{lx}{numeric. Lifetable survivorship}
\item{ndx}{numeric. Lifetable deaths distribution.}
\item{nLx}{numeric. Lifetable exposure.}
\item{Sx}{numeric. Survivor ratios in uniform 5-year age groups.}
\item{Tx}{numeric. Lifetable total years left to live above age x.}
\item{ex}{numeric. Age-specific remaining life expectancy.}
}
}
\description{
Computes abridged life table columns based on the lx, nLx , and ex values from
a single year life table, in accordance with step 2.2 of the Human Life Table Protocol
https://www.lifetable.de/methodology.pdf. Output abridged life table has same open age group
as input single age life table
