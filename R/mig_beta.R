#' Estimate intercensal migration by comparing census population, by age and
#' sex, to the results of a RUP projection.
#'
#' @description
#' This methods projects population from the first starting point to next census
#' without migration and computes the "Net Census Error" (NCE) which is
#' Census - Estimate by age from projection. It then distributes the NCE over
#' the cohort parallelogram assuming uniform distribution assuming it is all
#' migration. It finalizes by summing the estimate by age groups across the entire
#' intercensal period to have a total migration during the entire period.
#'
#' @param c1 numeric vector. The first (left) census in single age groups
#' @param c2 numeric vector. The second (right) census in single age groups
#' @param date1 reference date of c1`. Either a Date class object or an unambiguous character string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
#' @param date2 reference date of c2`. Either a Date class object or an unambiguous character string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
#' @param age1 integer vector. single ages of `c1`
#' @param age2 integer vector. single ages of `c2`
#' @param dates_out vector of desired output dates coercible to numeric using `dec.date()`
#' @param lxMat numeric matrix containing lifetable survivorship, `l(x)`. Each row is an age group and each column a time point. At least two intercensal time points needed.
#' @param age_lx integer vector. Age classes in `lxMat`
#' @param dates_lx date, character, or numeric vector of the column time points for `lxMat`. If these are calendar-year estimates, then you can choose mid-year time points
#' @param births integer vector. Raw birth counts for the corresponding (sub)-population, one value per each year of the intercensal period including both census years. The first and last years should include all births in the given year; don't discount them in advance.
#' @param years_births numeric vector of calendar years of births.
#' @param location country name or LocID
#' @param sex character string, either `"male"`, `"female"`, or `"both"`
#' @param midyear logical. `FALSE` means all Jan 1 dates between `date1` and `date2` are returned. `TRUE` means all July 1 intercensal dates are returned.
#' @param verbose logical. Shall we send informative messages to the console?
#' @param ... optional arguments passed to \code{lt_single_qx}
#' @export
#'
#' @return a numeric vector of the total migration in the intercensal period
#' for each age. Ages are set as names of each migration estimate.
